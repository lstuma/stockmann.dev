Arp spoofing
# Arp Spoofing
## What is ARP?
Since the Internet Protocol runs upon the Ethernet Protocol, the physical addresses (MAC addresses) of receiving hosts are required for packet transmission. However, when sending a packet using the Internet Protocol, one usually does not know the physical address of a target host. The discovery of the MAC address of a host (on a Local Area Network) works using the Address Resolution Protocol. ARP works by sending broadcast Ethernet Frames requesting the owner of a given IP to answer with their respective MAC address. Once the sending host receives an ARP response, they can start packet transmission.

## Spoofing ARP responses for MiM attacks
After receiving an ARP response from an unidentified machine a host will write a new entry to its ARP-Cache. This entry will specify which IP address owns the given MAC address and will therefore be used for any future transmission attempts from the host. If an attacker can gain control over the ARP-Cache of two clients they could trick both into sending packets to the attacker instead of the actual receiving client. This process is called *ARP Poisoning*. The attacker could then forward these packets and inspect any traffic between both targets. If the traffic is not or poorly encrypted an attacker could find potential credentials or similarly valuable information.

## arpspoof
One very powerful tool to conduct ARP Spoofing is [*arpspoof*](https://github.com/smikims/arpspoof).
```bash
$ arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2
```
This will perform an ARP Spoofing attack on the hosts 192.168.0.1 and 192.168.0.2 enabling a potential attacker to intercept any packets send between the target hosts.
