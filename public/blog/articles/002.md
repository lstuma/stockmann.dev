.zip and .mov Phishing
# .zip and .mov Phishing
## Context

The persistent threat of phishing continues to grow unabated and Google's recent contentious decision to offer .zip and .mov top level domains for public purchase will only exacerbate the security landscape. Given the prevalence of .zip and .mov file extensions the domains are poised to become highly sought-after, yet it is exactly this widespread popularity that places uses at risk.
## Phishing URLs using .zip and .mov domains

Potential victims of phishing attacks may unknowingly mistake seemingly inconspicuous URL for trusted sources, unwittingly navigating to websites. Consider the following URL, for instance: `https://stockmann.dev∕files∕general∕@draftv1.zip`. This URL actually leads to the site at draftv1.zip due to a combination of factors:
Primarily the presence of the @ symbol in the URL designates the content preceding it as HTTP GET authentication credentials: `https://user:password@example.org`. However, this alone is not sufficient to successfully direct users to a malicious site, since inserting a forward slash into the user or password parameter will render them invalid.
For instance, `https://example.org/user:password@malicious.site` is not a valid URL for accessing malicious.site and will instead result in a request for `/user:password@malicious.site` from the server located at `malicious.site`. To circumvent this safeguard, an attacker can utilize special Unicode characters (U+2044 and U+2215) closely resembling the standard forward slash. This subtle alteration effectively causes the URL to point towards the malicious site, thereby compromising potential victims.
